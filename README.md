# tiled2c
This tool is very simplistic and is a variation of the one written to convert between Tiled map editor CSV exports
and a format for the sega saturn using JO-engine.

THis tool is written for the purpose of taking CSV exports of tilemaps in Tiled map editor and converting them into
a C array. THere isnt a bunch of error checking and thus you must enter in the right data to get a valid conversion.

I didnt bother to improve it much because it just works. Feel free to modify or change it to suit your needs.
